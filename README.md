# ðŸ§± Cement Strength Prediction using XGBoost

A complete machine learning pipeline to predict the **strength class of cement-based materials** using features extracted from noisy raw data. The solution includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training with XGBoost, evaluation, and final prediction generation.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

In this project, we are given datasets that contain information about cement mix components and need to classify whether the concrete outcome is strong (1) or weak (0). Some of the columns (like `cement_water` and `coarse_fine_aggregate`) contain **two values embedded in a single string**, which must be split and converted into usable features.

## ðŸ“Š Features Used

After cleaning, the following features are used to train the model:

- `cement`
- `water`
- `slag`
- `fly_ash`
- `plasticizer`
- `coarse_aggregate`
- `fine_aggregate`
- `age`

**Target**: `outcome` (0 = weak, 1 = strong)

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Logic

The original columns like `"cement_water"` or `"coarse_fine_aggregate"` are strings with embedded numbers. We use regular expressions to:

1. Extract two float values.
2. Split them into individual columns like `cement`, `water`, `coarse_aggregate`, and `fine_aggregate`.
3. Drop the original mixed columns.

Example:
```python
"400.0 180.0" -> cement: 400.0, water: 180.0
